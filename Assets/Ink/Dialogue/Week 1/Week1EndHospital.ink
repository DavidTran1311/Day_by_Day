 Wouldn't be the first time. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125

...no. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
But, how can I not? #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
This is the first time you come here in weeks. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
I get that you have a job and it's the only thing keeping George here. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125

We're here for George anyway. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125

The doctor says his condition is worsening. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
I- I don't know how long he has. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
Didn't the doctor say that he was looking better? #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
I know, I know. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
She said something about the leukemia and how the treatment isn't going well. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
I don't know how long I can go like this. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125

=== supposedToMean ===
I'm just saying, we have to think about the situation if something, y'know, bad happens. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
+ I'm not thinking about that. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 He's my son. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 I don't want to think that anything will happen to my son. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 He still has time. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 -> possibility

+ How can you think that? #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
He's my son. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
I can't believe you'd think something like that. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
We're far from that. He still has time. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF

=== possibility ===
 Oh, so now you're going to act like a father? #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
 He's my son too. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
 We have to consider it as a possibility. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
 I'm just preparing us for what might happen. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
 I'm not going to let it go like that without even seeing what can be done. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 I won't. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 He's too young. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 There's so much for him to see. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 ... #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
 I want to talk to the doctor. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 There must be something more that can be done. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
  -> END

If it keeps going like this, we have to start thinking about the possible situations.#speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
I hate to say it, but we have to think about what might happen to George if he gets even worse. #speaker:Lily #portrait:lily_neutral #speaker_color: 1FD125
+ How can you say that? #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
 He's my son. #speaker:Mr. Davis #portrait:davis_neutral #speaker_color: 3D77FF
